# through an interactive setup process that is appropriate for users wishing
# to control the location of Rabbit, etc.
#
# The script is also capable of performing a non-interactive automated all-
# in-one single-system setup. To perform the automated setup, set the
# environment variable SANDFLY_SETUP_AUTO_HOSTNAME to the hostname of the
# Sandfly server.
#
# By default, the script will use the version from the ../VERSION file
# and will pull images from the quay.io/sandfly Docker repository. To
# override these defaults, set SANDFLY_SETUP_VERSION to the version tag
# on the sandfly-server-mgmt Docker image and/or set
# SANDFLY_SETUP_DOCKER_BASE to the prefix of the Docker image tag to use.
